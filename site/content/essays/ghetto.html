	<h2>Life Doesn't Matter Here </h2>
	<p class="lead">When I arrived here a year ago I thought it couldn't be that bad; when I leave here I will know that it can't be much worse.  Inner city life is a like your worst nightmare come true.</p>
	<p>After my major bipolar manic episode and failed suicide attempt I was afraid to live alone.  I was also being evicted from my apartment so I had no place to live anyway so I went to a men's transitional house at NHS Fresh Start.  It is still shocking to me that I ended up there, like something you see in an episode of a TV drama like "Law and Order" but this essay isn't about me.  It is about the ghetto of Philadlphia, a place called Kensington.</p>
